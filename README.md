# Bootcamp Alumni Network

## Project Overview
Completing a coding bootcamp can be a daunting and overwhelming experience. This project aims to develop a comprehensive website dedicated to bootcamp alumni and prospective students, providing them with valuable resources, networking opportunities, and support to transition smoothly into their professional careers.

## Features
- **Note Sharing and Learning Strategies:** Alumni can post notes, study guides, and personal strategies that helped them succeed during the bootcamp.
- **Job Opportunities and Networking:** A section for sharing job opportunities, internships, and freelance projects. Alumni can also announce their job placements.
- **Bootcamp Reviews and Tips:** A review section where alumni can provide detailed feedback on their bootcamp experience, including tips on navigating the course.
- **Community Support:** Forums and discussion boards for alumni to stay connected, offer mutual support, and share updates on their career progress.
- **Career Services:** Long-term career support services such as exploring career options, developing professional goals, addressing gaps in work experience, networking best practices, and more.

## Project Requirements
For this project, your group will conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem. You will create a collaborative MERN-stack single-page application that combines a scalable MongoDB back end, a GraphQL API, and an Express.js and Node.js server with a React front end, implementing user authentication with JWT.

### Key Requirements:
- **Front End:** Use React with Material UI.
- **Back End:** Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server, MongoDB with Mongoose ODM.
- **Deployment:** Deploy using Render.

### Functional Requirements:
- Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.
- Ensure the application is responsive, interactive, and has a polished UI.
- Implement authentication using JWT.
- Protect sensitive API key information on the server.
- Maintain a clean repository adhering to quality coding standards.

## Problem Statement
Completing a coding bootcamp can be an overwhelming experience for many students due to the intense pace and dense learning materials. Graduates often feel isolated and uncertain about their next steps despite acquiring valuable skills. Additionally, prospective students lack a centralized platform to access firsthand reviews and tips from previous students.

## Proposed Solution
To address these challenges, we propose the development of a comprehensive website dedicated to bootcamp alumni and prospective students. This platform will offer:

- **Note Sharing and Learning Strategies:** Alumni can post their notes, study guides, and personal strategies.
- **Job Opportunities and Networking:** A dedicated section for sharing job opportunities, internships, and freelance projects. Alumni can also announce their job placements.
- **Bootcamp Reviews and Tips:** A review section for detailed feedback on the bootcamp experience, including navigation tips, time management, and resource leverage.
- **Community Support:** Forums and discussion boards for alumni to stay connected, offer support, and share career progress updates.

This platform aims to foster a supportive community that helps bootcamp graduates transition smoothly into their professional careers while providing invaluable insights to new and upcoming students.
